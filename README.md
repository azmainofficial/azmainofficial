## 🎶 Now Playing on Spotify
Note: Publicly embedding Spotify widgets in README requires a refresh token / client credentials, which must not be committed publicly. The previous README included `client_id`, `client_secret`, and `refresh_token` directly in the image URL — that won't work and is insecure.

If you'd like a dynamic "Now Playing" card:
- Use a small GitHub Action to generate/update an image using secrets stored in the repo (recommended).
- Or use an external service that only requires a single public token (but read their security docs).

Example (do not paste secrets into README):
- Use a GitHub Action that reads secrets: SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID, SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET, SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN and generates an image to /assets/spotify-now-playing.png which you then reference here.

For now, a safe placeholder:
<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/spotify-placeholder.png" alt="now playing" width="400"/>
</div>

## 💭 Daily Dev Quote
If the dynamic quote image is failing, consider switching to a static quote or embedding a small script that updates the file via Actions.

## 🐍 Contribution Snake
This image is generated by a script and must exist at output/github-contribution-grid-snake.svg to render. If you see a broken image, run the generation script or remove this badge.

## Troubleshooting — fixes applied and recommendations
I reviewed the README and made a few safe edits to remove insecure/inoperative patterns and to add guidance. Here are the common failure points and what I changed or recommend:

- Spotify widget with secrets in the URL
  - Problem: Insecure and won't work (most services require server-side token refresh).
  - Fix: Replaced the live widget with a placeholder and added setup instructions for a GitHub Action that updates a local asset using repo secrets.

- External dynamic widgets (quotes, techstack, custom hearts GIFs)
  - Problem: Third-party services sometimes rate-limit or block hotlinking.
  - Fix: Added notes and fallback static content. Recommended generating assets in-repo (via CI) or hosting stable images in /assets.

- Images that referenced files in other branches or locations
  - Problem: Broken links.
  - Fix: Prefer canonical raw.githubusercontent.com links or local assets. Example heart.gif updated to reference a local-ish path; if you don't have it, replace with your own asset in /assets/.

- Stats endpoints (github-readme-stats, streak-stats)
  - Problem: Occasionally rate-limited or cached.
  - Fix: Kept them, but added note so you know they're external services. If you hit limits, consider self-hosting or switching to static badges.

- Contribution snake & generated images
  - Problem: These need a generation script. If they don't exist they will show as broken images.
  - Fix: Added a clear note and used a local path so you know where to place the generated SVG.

If you want, I can:
- Push this modified README.md to your repository (I can create a branch and open a PR). Tell me the repo (owner/repo) and branch name you prefer.
- Or I can modify the README further: e.g., convert all dynamic widgets into a GitHub Action workflow that generates the images (I can draft that workflow and the scripts).

Which would you like me to do next?
